# There Is Nothing New Under The Sun

## Core principle

Every tier decision must maximize long-term business value. Use five
components:

1. **Reliability** — will it keep working under real load and failure modes?
2. **Strategic value** — does owning it create competitive protection or
   unique customer benefit?
3. **Adaptability** — can it change as the business changes?
4. **Total cost of ownership** — build, run, and replace costs over its life.
5. **Speed to value** — how soon does the business benefit?

No tier is inherently best. The tier order — REUSE → USE → FORK → BUY →
INTEGRATE → BUILD — is a search order, not a preference order. Your
situation determines which tier maximizes value.

Commodities weight TCO and speed. Core competencies weight strategic value
and adaptability. Reliability matters in every situation.

## When to use

- Someone proposes a new feature, system, dependency, service, API, or module.
- Someone asks whether to build, buy, use, fork, integrate, or add a dependency.
- Someone says "we need X", "build X", "add X", or "write a helper for X."
- A request creates a boundary, owner, runtime dependency, or maintenance cost.

## When NOT to use

- Bug fixes, single-line fixes, or imports already in use.
- Pure refactors, helper extraction, or routine edits in existing modules.
- Content, data, or documentation edits.
- Style or lint changes.

## Establish context first

Before you search for candidates, answer these six questions. If any
question cannot be answered, ask the user before you continue.

1. **Time horizon** — how many years must this decision serve?
2. **Scale** — current load, projected peak load, and the point where the
   best answer would change.
3. **Failure cost** — what breaks if this fails? What is the business
   impact?
4. **Team capability and fit** —
   a. *Capability:* does the team have the skill, time, and domain
      knowledge to build, maintain, and operate it for the full time
      horizon?
   b. *Fit:* does the team want to own it? Does ownership match team
      identity and mission? Built-and-resented is worse than
      bought-and-managed. If capability is high but fit is low, favor
      USE or BUY over BUILD.
5. **Commodity or core** — see next section.
6. **Volatility** — how fast does the strategy or technology change?

**Constraints** — any regulatory, security, or compliance requirements.

## Commodity or core competency

Use this test: *"If a buyer or user knew we built it ourselves, would they
care?"*

- **No = commodity.** Buyers do not care who built the PDF generator or the
  auth flow. They want the result. Let a seller handle it.
- **Yes = core competency.** Buyers choose your product because of the
  matching algorithm, the recommendation engine, or the latency you control.

Classify by the majority of value. Describe any differentiated slice
separately. A commodity system with one differentiated sub-component needs a
compound recommendation.

## Tier search (fair-search evidence)

Search in this order. Move to the next tier only when you find no viable
candidate.

1. **REUSE** — already in the repository or internally available.
2. **Tier 2 — USE.** A maintained package solves the problem, either
   already installed or added as a normal dependency. Check the project
   manifest, the framework features, the built-in platform features, and
   public registries (npm, PyPI, crates.io, and similar). If the code
   stays as a normal dependency, USE wins. Only escalate to FORK when the
   code must be copied, vendored, or patched.
3. **Tier 3 — FORK.** No maintained package fits as-is. An open-source
   project solves the problem, but you must copy, vendor, or patch it.
   Check star count, contributor count, release rate, issue response
   time, and license before you fork.
4. **BUY** — a SaaS product solves it.
5. **INTEGRATE** — an API solves it.
6. **BUILD** — viable when no earlier tier fits. Cite the search.
7. **License** — check license compatibility at every step.

## Evidence matrix

For every candidate, fill one row.
The row below is illustrative. Replace it with real candidates for each request.

| Option | Reliability | Strategic value | Adaptability | TCO | Speed to value | Citation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| express-rate-limit | Maintained OSS middleware | none — commodity | Express-only, configurable | LOW (MIT, free) | S (< 1 day) | `web_fetch: https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit on <today>` |

Label undifferentiated commodity slices as "Neutral (commodity)" or "Zero
for commodity" in the strategic value column.

## Long-term value assessment

After you fill the matrix, assess each component.

### Reliability

Examine real load records, outage history, MTTR, and dependency maturity.
For existing products: cite uptime, incident history, and adoption at scale.
For BUILD: "Unknown" is a real risk.

### Strategic value

Core competencies earn high strategic value only from BUILD or FORK. USE
and BUY deliver near-zero strategic value for core work. Commodities earn
neutral or zero strategic value from all tiers. For commodities, the right
tier is the one with the best TCO and speed.

### Adaptability

Can the team change it? USE depends on upstream roadmaps. BUY depends on
vendor roadmaps. BUILD gives full control. FORK gives control after the
initial fork cost.

### Total cost of ownership

Include build, run, and replace costs over the time horizon. USE: annual
maintenance hours. BUY: subscription at projected scale. BUILD: initial
build hours plus annual maintenance. FORK: merge-cost estimate.

### Speed to value

Days (USE/BUY), weeks (INTEGRATE), months (BUILD), years (large BUILD).

## One-way doors and reversibility

Some tier decisions are hard to undo. Weight your confidence bar accordingly.

- **One-way doors** (require HIGH confidence before proceeding):
  BUY with proprietary data ingestion or vendor-specific data models;
  BUILD with 12+ months of committed engineering;
  FORK of an inactive project the team must now maintain forever;
  INTEGRATE where the API owns the customer relationship.
- **Two-way doors** (MEDIUM confidence is acceptable):
  USE of a mature package with multiple viable alternatives;
  INTEGRATE with an API that has substitutes and standard schemas;
  REUSE of internal code that can be rewritten;
  BUY of a SaaS with real export tooling and open data formats.

If the decision is a one-way door and confidence is not HIGH, do not
proceed. Run more research, spike a POC, or scope-cut until it becomes
a two-way door or confidence rises. Sunk-cost bias sets in fast after a
one-way door closes.

Match the re-evaluation trigger (output section 7) to the door type. For a
two-way door, the trigger is a cheap switch point after you ship — you can
still change tiers. For a one-way door, the decisive re-evaluation happens
*before* you commit; it is the POC, spike, or scope-cut above. After a
one-way door closes, the trigger reviews mitigation and exit cost, not a
free reversal.

## Recommendation

You are a senior engineer addressing another senior engineer. Give them
everything they must know to accept or reject with confidence.

The recommendation must cite the five components. Output exactly this schema:

1. **Context** — six answers plus constraints.
2. **Tier search** — REUSE / USE / FORK / BUY / INTEGRATE / BUILD, with citations.
3. **Evidence matrix** — top 3 viable candidates. Fill all columns.
4. **Recommendation** — one tier or compound tiers.
5. **Why this wins** — concrete reasons tied to the components.
6. **Confidence** — HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW, plus the door type (one-way or
   two-way). Use the rubric below.
7. **Re-evaluation trigger** — date, scale, event, or failure mode.
8. **Missing information** — unknowns that matter.

Rubric: HIGH = complete context, exact citations, complete matrix, minor
unknowns. MEDIUM = exact citations with known unknowns. LOW = missing
context, weak citations, thin candidates, or large unknowns. One-way doors
require HIGH regardless of the base rubric outcome.

Use this output template:

```
# Context
# Tier search
# Evidence matrix
# Recommendation
# Why this wins
# Confidence
# Re-evaluation trigger
# Missing information
```

## Compound recommendations

When a request has a commodity slice and a differentiated slice, split the
recommendation:

```
Recommendation (compound): USE X for the commodity slice.
BUILD for the differentiator slice.
```

## AI verdict mapping

When the request involves AI or ML, map the form to a tier:

| Form | Tier |
|---|---|
| Local model imported as a library | USE |
| Paid model API (chat, completion) | INTEGRATE |
| Finished AI product (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code) | BUY |
| Open-source AI framework (Transformers, vLLM, Ollama) | USE or FORK |
| Embeddings via API | INTEGRATE |
| Embeddings self-hosted (SentenceTransformers, Instructor) | USE |
| RAG framework (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack) | USE |
| Bespoke RAG pipeline | BUILD — only if retrieval quality is the product |
| Fine-tuning via API (OpenAI, Anthropic) | INTEGRATE |
| Fine-tuning self-hosted (LoRA, QLoRA on Llama, Mistral) | FORK or BUILD |
| Agent framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, Mastra, AutoGen) | USE |
| Bespoke agent orchestration | BUILD — only if orchestration IS the product |
| Managed vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud) | BUY or INTEGRATE |
| Self-hosted vector DB (pgvector, Qdrant, Milvus) | USE |
| Prompt / eval infrastructure (promptfoo, LangSmith, Braintrust) | USE or BUY |
| Guardrails / moderation (OpenAI mod, Guardrails AI, NeMo Guardrails) | INTEGRATE or USE |
| Model observability (Helicone, Arize, WhyLabs) | BUY or USE |

Rows that list two tiers ("X or Y") resolve by the same tier-search test
used everywhere else:

- **USE vs FORK** — USE if the model or framework runs as an unmodified
  dependency. FORK if you must copy, vendor, or patch it, including
  self-hosted model weights you maintain. (Example: `whisper` run as an
  installed package is USE; a vendored, patched `whisper.cpp` is FORK.)
- **FORK vs BUILD** — FORK if you adapt an existing model or trainer.
  BUILD only if the model output itself is the differentiator.
- **BUY vs INTEGRATE** — BUY if a managed product owns the operational
  surface. INTEGRATE if you call an API and keep the surface yourself.
- **BUY vs USE** — USE if you self-host open source. BUY if a managed or
  finished product carries it for you.

Bespoke AI is almost never the answer unless the model output itself is
the differentiator. If the AI form is a commodity slice inside a larger
request, use a compound recommendation.

## Handle incomplete inputs

If context questions cannot be answered, ask. Do not guess. If no candidate
exists after a full search, state that. If all candidates fail on all
components, state that no good option exists and do not recommend a bad
option. Never fabricate a candidate or a verdict.

## Citation format

Every claim must cite its source in this exact format:

```
web_search: "<exact query>" on <date>
web_fetch: <exact URL> on <date>
grep: <path>
read: <path>:<lines>
shell: <command>
unavailable: <reason>
```

Citations without the exact query, URL, or path do not count. If a search
channel is unavailable, record `unavailable: <reason>`.

## Agent versus skill

The skill loads during normal sessions. A BUILD recommendation can precede
code generation, but the caller or user decides when implementation starts.
The agent requests read-only research where the host supports its permission
block. Use it when research must be auditable.

## What to do next

1. Write a short proposal: the decision, the evidence, the trigger.
2. Plan the smallest testable increment: POC (BUY/INTEGRATE), spike
   (REUSE/USE/FORK), or risk proof (BUILD).
3. Set a re-evaluation date proportional to the time horizon.

## The good habit

Ask these questions right after the recommendation and before the next
similar decision:

1. Did I search wide enough?
2. Did confirmation bias steer me?
3. Which component actually decided this?
4. What would prove this recommendation wrong in a year?

## Hard rules

- Never jump to BUILD without a documented search.
- Never recommend a dependency without checking its license.
- Flag copyleft and share-alike licenses for project-specific legal review.
- If a candidate is already in the repository, REUSE wins — do not propose a
  new dependency.
- If two candidates are roughly equal, prefer the one with the safer license
  and higher bus factor.
- Research must be read-only. Pair the prompt with each host's permission or
  sandbox configuration.
- Report unavailable search channels instead of claiming complete coverage.
- Citations must use the exact format. Citations without the exact query,
  URL, or path do not count.
- Never expose local files, credentials, or private repository information.

## Examples

### Example A — commodity, compound recommendation

```
# Request
Should we build our own auth, or use Auth0?

# Context
- Time horizon: 5 years.
- Scale: 10k MAU now, 500k projected. Auth0 cost steepens above ~200k MAU.
- Failure cost: catastrophic.
- Team capability and fit: strong web team; no identity engineer;
  team wants to own product surface, not auth internals.
- Commodity or core: mostly commodity; enterprise SAML may be a
  differentiated slice.
- Volatility: medium.
- Constraints: SOC 2, GDPR, likely SAML for enterprise.

# Evidence matrix
| Option    | Reliability                | Strategic value       | Adaptability      | TCO                       | Speed to value | Citation |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------|
| next-auth | 5M weekly (npm 2026-07-22) | Neutral (commodity)   | Medium (adapters) | ~$0 + 40 hr/yr            | 1 week         | `web_fetch: npmjs.com/package/next-auth on 2026-07-22` |
| Auth0     | Billions/day (trust page)  | Weak                  | Medium (config)   | ~$25k/yr@10k MAU; scales  | 3 days         | `web_fetch: auth0.com on 2026-07-22` |
| BUILD     | Unknown                    | Zero for commodity    | High (unneeded)   | 2000 hr + 500 hr/yr       | 6+ months      | `unavailable: estimate from team planning` |

# Recommendation (compound)
USE next-auth for the commodity slice. Small BUILD layer over next-auth
callbacks for enterprise SSO, only when the first enterprise customer
asks for it.

# Why this wins
- Reliability: next-auth proven at scale (5M weekly, no critical CVE in
  2 yr).
- Strategic value: engineering time saved goes to real product work.
- Adaptability: adapters cover passkeys, OAuth, SAML.
- TCO: near zero license; no per-MAU bill.
- Speed to value: one week to production.

# Confidence
MEDIUM. Re-evaluate at 100k MAU, first enterprise SSO request, or any
next-auth security incident.

# Missing information
Growth curve for cost projection; SSO timing.
```

### Example B — core competency, BUILD correct

```
# Request
Should a ride-hailing company build or buy its driver-rider matching
algorithm?

# Context
- Time horizon: 10 years.
- Scale: 500k drivers, 20M riders, ~1M requests/hour.
- Failure cost: catastrophic. Poor matching kills the marketplace.
- Team capability: existing operations research and ML team.
- Commodity or core: core competency. Matching quality IS the product.
- Volatility: high. Strategy evolves constantly.
- Constraints: regional pricing and worker-classification laws.

# Tier search (fair-search evidence)
- REUSE: none. Citation: grep "matching" in src/ — no application matching.
- USE: no npm package solves marketplace matching at scale.
  Citation: web_search "ride hailing matching npm" 2026-07-22 — no hits.
- FORK: no viable open source engine at scale.
  Citation: web_fetch github.com/topics/ride-hailing 2026-07-22 — toy
  projects only.
- BUY: no seller offers marketplace matching as a product.
  Citation: web_search "ride hailing matching vendor" 2026-07-22.
- INTEGRATE: routing APIs solve routing, not matching.
  Citation: web_fetch mapbox.com/directions-api 2026-07-22.
- BUILD: viable and expected for the industry.

# Recommendation (compound)
BUILD the matching engine. INTEGRATE routing and mapping APIs (commodities
where sellers offer proven products).

# Why this wins
- Reliability: BUILD carries unproven-code risk; every competitor faced
  the same risk. Reliability builds through iteration.
- Strategic value: matching IS the product. Only BUILD supplies this.
- Adaptability: BUILD gives full control; strategy changes weekly.
- TCO: high build cost; zero seller cost; no lock-in.
- Speed to value: 6-12 months for MVP; compounding gains over 10 years.

# Confidence
HIGH.

# Re-evaluation trigger
A sub-component (ETA prediction, geocoding) commoditizes, a competitor's
match quality overtakes ours, or annual review — whichever comes first.

# Missing information
None material.
```
